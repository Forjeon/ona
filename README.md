Ona is a minimalist CLI for interacting with Ollama models for note taking and summarizing. I discovered that most of the features provided by [open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) were just bloat for my purposes, plus it felt wasteful to run a full 30GB Docker container just to hit an LLM with an occasional quick query. Thus, I created Ona.  

Ona has one purpose and one purpose onlyâ€”to send a dynamically prefilled prompt to an Ollama model and present the response. Ona is intended for simple one-off queries, so no context is saved between prompts, making LLM processing time faster.  

Ona is completely FOSS, and you are encouraged to clone, copy, fork, and otherwise benefit from this project.
